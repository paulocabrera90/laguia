<h1>jPFChat Help Topics</h1>

<p>Most users who open this help screen are doing so because they've encountered one of a few known issues.  We're addressing the most common ones here.</p>
   
<p>Please remember that we did NOT write phpFreeChat (<a href="http://www.phpfreechat.net">www.phpfreechat.net</a>).&nbsp; 
We wrote the interface that allows phpFreeChat to be used inside of Joomla.&nbsp; 
Many issues that users write us about are not jPFChat issues.&nbsp; They are 
issues with the Chat script itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've got NO input, control over 
or ability to influence the development of the phpFreeChat script.&nbsp; Please 
visit their website for information or issues specific to their chat script.</p>
<p>There are two main issues we keep hearing about over and over and over....</p>
<p><b>Usernames:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; If usernames are not being picked up, please 
remember that jPFChat will only recognize users who were logged into Joomla 
BEFORE they came into the chat room.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they were in the Chat Room 
at ANY TIME prior to logging into Joomla, then the cache will recognize them as 
the &quot;connection&quot; they were before logging in.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a phpfreechat 
shortcoming that we haven't created a workaround for yet.</p>
<p><b>jPFChat doesn't Load:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is MOST LIKELY due to a 
MooTools javascript library conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joomla 1.5.x includes a native 
MooTools javascript library, and MANY templates load it even if it's not 
actually being used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Joomla 1.0.x templates use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In addition, many Modules for both Joomla versions load MooTools as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If the MooTools library is loaded... then jPFChat will NOT function properly... 
especially in the Internet Explorer browser.&nbsp; FireFox seems to work OK in 
some cases, but there have been reports of odd behavior even if jPFChat does 
actually load up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't write us about MooTools.&nbsp; 
We are completely and fully aware of the conflict... we're working on a possible 
fix... and there are several possible short-term workarounds already posted on 
the <a href="http://www.jpfchat.com">www.jpfchat.com</a> website.&nbsp; Read the 
articles about it there.</p>
